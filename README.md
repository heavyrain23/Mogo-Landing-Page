# Mogo-Landing-Page
This simple landing page was built with html, css and js. For html i've used the BEM methodology. Also the htlm document contains fonts downloaded from fonts.google.com. The fontawesome.com source was used to display special icons.
I've used the Jquery library and downloaded a slick-carousel from the official website to make a website animation
Also a responsive version for devices with 1230px, 990px, 770px and 575px width was realized In this project.
